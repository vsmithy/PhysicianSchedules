# Physician Scheduling App

This app has a very specific use-case: rapid doctor's schedule creation. Source data varies from notes in emails, to spreadsheets, to actual sheets of paper with random people's writing stuff :-) WIP Screens available [on my website](http://videlsmith.com/).

## Tools and Libraries Used
* React
* Redux
* SASS
* xlsx-populate
* Firebase
* FontAwesome Icons
* Google Fonts
* Balsamiq for the initial mockup

## Project is still WIP, but to check it out:
* Clone/Download
* NPM Install While In PhysicianSchedules Folder
* NPM Start

## Next Steps and Tweaks
1. Currently building out an Auto-Fill feature that uses business logic to fill in parts of the calendar automatically
2. After that, I will clean up the styling and verify cross-browser compatibility
3. Add the calendarView portion of the app
4. I have a 'helpful files' folder that I need to clean up and make into a standard thing that I import for all of my projects
