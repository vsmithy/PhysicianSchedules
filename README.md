# Physician Scheduling App

Something that helps do some stuff in an easy and intuitive way.

## Backstory
Because who wants to sit and click around on some mystical technology device highlighting rectangles using some wierd software that you really could not care less about while trying to make something legible, pretty?, AND useful when you have patients to see, surgeries to perform, coders to deal with, notes to write, call shifts, nurses to share cookies with, patients to argue with about how their google search result doesn't equate to a medical degree, more notes to write, residents to confuse, patients to call back, and extra random call shifts to cover because one of your colleagues has some wierd world view that includes actually calling off of work and taking care of yourself when you are sick???

Well...the schedule making duties have recently added to my wife's list of things to do and the current process is really manual and time consuming, so I am making something that will automate away quite a bit of the initial schedule creation work and save her a few hours each month. It will mostly be a utility without any branding or ties to her actual job, so I will post the app here for other people who might be interested in working with schedule-making apps with extremely large sets of business logic concerning who does what.
